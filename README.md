Solo Pong - A Gravity Ball Survival Game

## Background
Solo Pong is an innovative take on the classic Pong game while offering a unique gameplay experience. Players control a ball's movement using the space bar, aiming to keep the ball afloat for as long as possible. The ball navigates by staying afloat while gravity continuously pulls it downward.

## Functionality & MVPs
In Solo Pong - Gravity Ball Survival Game, players will have access to:

- Initiating the game by pressing the space bar
- Controlling the ball's upward movement by tapping the space bar at strategic intervals
- Navigating the ball through narrow gaps between obstacles
- Recording and displaying the player's high score
- Restarting the game to attempt a new high score

This project will also encompass:

- A minimalist user interface with clear and concise instructions
- A visually appealing game environment with retro style graphics
- Smooth and responsive ball movement mechanics
